The tool also uses training data, collected from the client's classroom, to train a supervised learning algorithm (a decision tree created using scikit-learn) to predict a question's difficulty and thereby provide students with challenging yet manageable questions. The software also enables the creation of quizzes using questions from the database (and recommended by the machine learning algorithm). Additionally, the program includes timers, allows for freehand drawings, and includes a general 'home' to base lessons around.",
